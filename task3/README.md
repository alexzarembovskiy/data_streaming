# Investigation of kafka CLI tools - Kafka part

### 1) How to launch docker compose with Kafka:

- Using terminal, in folder ./task3, execute *docker compose up -d* command.

### 2) How to launch domains counter in Scala:

- Using IntelliJ IDEA, run *./task3/untitled/src/main/scala/domains/count/DomainsCount.scala* file.

### 3) What was done and what wasn`t:

- I have made generator, docke-compose file and Scala project that count words (domains);
- I have not done top 5, as I do not know Scala well.
